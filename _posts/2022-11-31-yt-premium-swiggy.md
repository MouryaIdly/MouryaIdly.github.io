Let’s say you watch YouTube for 5 hours a week, considering you have a full time job this is a pretty conservative amount. You may be watching tutorial videos, blogs or music videos. 

* The avg length of these videos is say 10 mins. So that brings us to 120 videos a month on average.
* Now I don’t have the stats for these but I noticed every third ad was an add from either Swiggy or Zomato.
* Let’s say 2/3rds of the videos on youtube are monetized ~80 vidoes
* 1/3rd of these videos show you a 6 sec ad from swiggy/zomato ~26 times
* So, on an average you watch a swiggy/zomato ad 26 times a month
* Even if 5% of the time (very conservative) you give into the ad and go order food immediatley or the thought of ordering food lingers in your mind for a while before you eventually give in (other 5% of the times).
    * 5%*26 = 1.3 , 5%*26 = 1.3 => 2.6
* 2.6 times, that’s the amount of times you order food due to these ads
* Average order value is say INR 200. This means  200*2.6 = INR 520

All said and done I think INR 139 a month is a good price to pay to save INR 380 a month and for a good health
