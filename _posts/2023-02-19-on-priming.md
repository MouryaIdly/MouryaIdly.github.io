So I just learned about the priming effect today from Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast & Slow. 
It is basically about influencing of an action by an idea. We do not notice this consciously but our actions and emotions can be primed by events which we are not even aware of.

* Advertisers use it to influence purchase decisions
* Film directories use it to influence how people view a film
* Color priming is also a very interesting topic
* The movie Inception 

This is also reciprocal, actions also tend to influence ideas. This is the reason people are advised to smile more, smiling evokes good thoughts and good thoughts evokes a smile.

I wonder if people who are influential have this natural ability. Do they intentionally use certain kinds of words to before getting to the point? I have to look into company’s annual financial annoucements when they are disappointing, do they want their investors to feel a certain way before they delve deeper into the reports?

I know politicians do it, see Teflon leaders for example. They make it a point that their image is always associated with everything good. You may also be primed to be obedient by being shown large images of our leaders. You don’t notice it but your opinion towards them is being influenced very slowly. Preaching morality also tends to make people more open to authoritarian ideas. Of course, this doesn’t influence rational people.

This does toe the line between influecing and manipulation but hey who’s judging?
So anyway, how does this help me in anyway? I make decks to influence companies so that’s a good place to practise it I guess. We tend to do this stuff naturally but surely being aware of priming makes your presentations all the more engaging
Creating an engaging story
Showing data at just the right place
Using the right icons
Using the right language
All this to bring them to the same conclusion you wanted them to bring. Phew.
