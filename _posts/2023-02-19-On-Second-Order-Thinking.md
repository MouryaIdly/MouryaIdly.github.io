On Second Order Thinking

I first came across this term when Kunal Shah mentioned it in one of his tweets. He infact believes in it so strongly that he has tweeted about in 16 times till date. Since nobody would to see all 16 of those tweets here is a short summary:

Second order thinkers have good judgement, do not jump to conclusions and exhibit great deal of self control to pause and think through their reasoning.

I, myself am a victim of my intition and sometimes get tempted to readily accept the first plausible explanation that comes to my mind. So why does this happen and can second order thinking be developed? 

According to Daniel Kahnehman, the author of Thinking, Fast and Slow, who describes in detail the two systems of the human mind. One that is fast and instinctive and the other slow and logical. System one doesn’t take any effort or time to deliver while system does. 

When posed a difficult proble two things happen,
1. The system one kicks in and puts forth the most reasonable answer to system two
2. System two calculates the amount of effort required to check the reasoning

People with low self control tend to accept this answer and are more likely to reach the wrong conclusion. People who exhibit a higher degree of self control do not succumb to this temptation and take the next step (second order) i.e invest effort to check their reasonings.

So, what traits in particular did second order thinkers exhibit?
Primarily, self-control to not give into the temptation and then the willingness to think through the reasoning. These two traits are what makes people rational. It is important to not confuse this attribute with intelligence. Smart people tend to be overconfident and are prone to place too much faith in their intuition. 

Now that you are aware how how your mind works while reasoning, the next time when you try to reson a complex problem, remember the two words self-control and willingness. This will trigger your brain to recognize when you reached a conclusion and force you to reason further. This will become a habit over time and you’ll find yourself making the right decisions/judgements most of the time.

I’ll be updating in a month’s time on whether this method has had any meaningful impact or not.
