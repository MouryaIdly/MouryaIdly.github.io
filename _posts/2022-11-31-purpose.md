The idea is to track my thoughts and see how they develop over the years. The thoughts you get from reading a book, watching a movie or understanding a concept for the first time are never the same once you do it again after a few months. By capturing this, I hope to get clarity over my thoughts and more importantly document my feelings.

So, starting out this website will be divided into three parts,

* Book Thoughts

    I want to start by writing book reviews about critical thinking and frameworks and hope this will help me comprehend other genres of books better.

* Random Thoughts

    Ever had a random thought pop into your mind out of nowhere that stayed in your mind for a few hours never to be heard again. 
    Well, this is where I try to put into words any interesting thought that comes to me whether right or horribly wrong.

* Case Studies

    I haven't put much thought into this yet, but this is pretty important for B-School. So I'll visit this some time later, much much later.




Cheers!
